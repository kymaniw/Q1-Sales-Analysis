<h6>Main Insights:</h6>

Discovered an absurdly low gross profit margin for the quarter at a staggering 4.6%

In regards to customer behavior and business performance, I found that 22.7% of transactions generate revenue above $500, and  16.6% of transactions received a high customer satisfaction rating. This concludes why the average customer rating for the quarter was so low at 6.97%.

Found that cash is the leading form of payment. This indicates missed opportunities for upselling or cross-selling high-value items as well as limited customer retention.

Peak sales times throughout the quarter were 1:00P.M. and 7:00P.M. 

<h6>Recommendations:</h6>
Most revenue comes from a smaller subset of transactions. Focusing on these high-value purchases can significantly impact profitability.

Improving customer satisfaction will likely lead to better retention, higher repeat purchase rates, and more high-revenue transactions.

Customers using cash may represent occasional buyers rather than loyal, returning customers. To combat this, encourage customers to use digital payments by linking them to rewards for repeat purchases. 

Implementing surge sales for certain rush hour times may improve profitability and revenue.
