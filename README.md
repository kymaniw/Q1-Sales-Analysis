This project analyzes sales data from a supermarket chain using SQL and Power BI to uncover key insights into revenue trends, customer behavior, and business performance. The analysis covers total sales, profit margins, peak sales periods, and customer segmentation.

Tools & Technologies
SQL Server: Data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
Power BI: Interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Key Metrics & Insights
1️⃣ Total Revenue & Profitability
Total Sales: $322,966.75
Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $307,587.38
Gross Profit Margin: 4.6% (low profitability indicates inefficiencies or pricing issues).
🟢 Visualization: KPI card in Power BI to track business profitability.
2️⃣ Best-Selling Product Lines
Top Revenue Product Line: Electronic Accessories
Least Revenue Product Line: Home & Lifestyle
High-selling products contribute significantly to total revenue, but profitability varies across categories.
🟢 Visualization: Bar chart comparing revenue across product lines.
3️⃣ Customer Segmentation & Behavior
Total Revenue by Customer Type:
Normal Customers: $158,743 (499 transactions)
Members: $164,223 (501 transactions)
Members generate slightly more revenue but show similar spending patterns to normal customers.
🟢 Visualization: Grouped bar chart comparing customer segments.
4️⃣ Sales Trends Over Time
Peak Sales Days: 2/7, 3/2, and 3/9.
Peak Sales Hours: 13:00 and 19:00 (likely due to lunch breaks and evening shopping).
Understanding peak times helps with staffing and inventory planning.
🟢 Visualization: Line charts showing daily and hourly sales trends.
5️⃣ Revenue by Payment Method
Highest Revenue Source: Cash transactions.
Electronic payments (E-wallet & Credit Card) underperform despite being more efficient.
Heavy reliance on cash could indicate limitations in digital payment adoption.
🟢 Visualization: Pie chart showing payment method distribution.
Next Steps
✅ Perform deeper profitability analysis per product line.
✅ Identify cost-cutting opportunities to improve margins.
✅ Use predictive analytics to forecast future sales trends.
